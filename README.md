# get-Contact
The code implements a simple Contact Management Program that allows users to store, search, update, and delete contacts. The program uses a map data structure to store contacts, where each contact is represented by a name and a phone number. The program provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the contact list.


Time complexity: O(n) for storing contacts, O(log n) for searching, updating, and deleting contacts, and O(1) for the main function.


Space complexity: O(n) for storing contacts, where n is the number of contacts in the map.
